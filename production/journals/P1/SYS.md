# SYS journal — P1

## P1.04 GameState (round 1, done)
- Built GameState.gd: 5 meters via clamping property setters, ratchet floor = peak−15, monotonic stage
  (interpretation — docs silent; flagged in handoff), day/turn/path/flags, 12 profile counters,
  to_dict/from_dict with healing. read→counter map is DATA at game/data/profile_map.json (+tone map
  for inconsistency swings); control/apathy come from classifier rules via bump_profile().
- Conventions: meters are float + StringName keys; profile/flags keyed by String for JSON safety;
  model input only via apply_mood/apply_read; signals fire on every real change (overlay-ready).
- Gotchas: property setters run during member init → declare instability_peak/stage BEFORE instability.
  gdUnit4 counts each test_* toward max-public-methods:20 and Variant receivers need explicit types.
  gdtoolkit rejects multi-line match patterns — used a const type array instead. JSON normalises ints
  to floats inside flags; the round-trip test compares in the JSON domain.
